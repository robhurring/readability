# Readability

Readability is a small app that calculates some information on given article URLs, such as the [Flesch Reading Ease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests), [Gunning-Fog Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index) and [Flesch-Kincaid grade level](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests#Flesch.E2.80.93Kincaid_Grade_Level).

This was built to help assist Clay Cazier's whitepaper on [Content Length, Readability & Organic Rankings](http://www.pmdigital.com/blog/2014/01/content-length-readability-organic-rankings/)
